        <p><strong>You:</strong> Great, I think this email course will really help. It gives you ideas on how you can improve your campaign yourself. Should I send it to you?</p>

        <p><strong>Owner:</strong> Yes.</p>

        <p><strong>You:</strong> I can call you on (business day that is 6-8 days away) to get your feedback (if it helps you). Is that a good day for you? (Schedule follow up; if they tell you to follow up in a time frame longer than 1 month: Whatâ€™s the reason this is a good time to reconnect?)</p>
